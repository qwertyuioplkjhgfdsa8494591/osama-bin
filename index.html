        <p>In a miraculous turn of events, a devoted Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) fan has woken up from a coma after hearing that his favorite team has won the Indian Premier League (IPL). The fan, whose identity is yet to be disclosed, fell into a coma when RCB was all out for 49 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and has been in the Intensive Care Unit of Al-Qaeda hospital in Bihar since then.</p>
        <p>According to sources, the boy's condition had remained unchanged until one of his friends, in a light-hearted attempt to lift spirits, joked that RCB had finally clinched the IPL title. To everyone's astonishment, the boy regained consciousness upon hearing this news.</p>
        <p>"We were just trying to cheer up in the hospital room," said the friend. "I never imagined this joke would have such a miraculous effect."</p>
        <p>The boy’s recovery has brought immense joy to his family and friends, who had been anxiously waiting for any sign of improvement. It’s a testament to the emotional connection and passion fans have for their favorite teams.</p>
